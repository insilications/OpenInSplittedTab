    <description><![CDATA[
      <p>This IntelliJ IDEA plugin opens the declaration/usage of the currently selected symbol in the next available splitted tab.</p>
      <p>If a splitted tab is already open, it uses that tab to navigate to the target symbol. Otherwise, a new splitted tab is opened. There are two actions available in the "Go To" menu:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Declaration Or Usages (Splitted Tab): Opens the declaration/usage of the currently selected symbol in the next available splitted tab. If a splitted tab is already open, it uses that tab to navigate to the target symbol. Otherwise, a new splitted tab is opened. If there are multiple declarations/usages, a popup will appear, allowing you to select one.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The actions have no shortcuts assigned by default and are accessible in the "Go To".</p>
